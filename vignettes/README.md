# Decription of the vignettes   

In the vignettes folder several examples are presented in order to illustrate the glmSparseNet package.

## Examples for gene expression of tumor data

The examples are regarding survival and logistic regression for different types of cancer.
All teh datasets analysed were obtained from the TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas).  

For the survival analysis, three types of cancer were considered:

  - breast (example_brca_survival.Rmd);
  - prostate (example_prad_survival.Rmd);
  - melanoma (example_skcm_survival.Rmd).

For the logistic regression the breast cancer was considered (example_brca_logistic).

## Network penalization (exhaustive example)

A more detailed example of the glmSparseNet package can be found in the Network_Penalization_TCGA.Rmd file. 
In this example a more meticulous and comprehensive analysis is described in order to understand the functions and visualization tools available in the package.
